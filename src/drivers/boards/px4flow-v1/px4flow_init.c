 *
 * Input Parameters:

 *     meaning of this status information is board-specific.  If not used by
 *     a board, the value zero may be provided in calls to board_reset.

 * Returned Value:
 *   If this function returns, then it was not possible to power-off the
 *   board due to some constraints.  The return value int this case is a
 *   board-specific reason for the failure to shutdown.
