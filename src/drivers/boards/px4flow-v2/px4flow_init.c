 *   putting the LEDs in their correct initial state.
 *
 *   NOTE: In most architectures, board_led_initialize() is called from
 *   board-specific initialization logic.  But there are a few architectures
 *   where this initialization function is still called from common chip
 *   architecture logic.  This interface is not, however, a common board
 *   interface in any event and, hence, the usage of the name
 *   board_led_initialize is deprecated.
 *
 *   WARNING: This interface name will eventually be removed; do not use it
 *   in new board ports.  New implementations should use the naming
 *   conventions for "Microprocessor-Specific Interfaces" or the "Board-
 *   Specific Interfaces" as described above.

 * Input Parameters:
 *   None

 * Name: board_crashdump
 *
 * Description:
 *   If CONFIG_BOARD_CRASHDUMP is selected then up_asseert will call out to
 *   board_crashdump prior to calling exit in the case of an assertion failure.
 *   Or in the case of a hardfault looping indefinitely. board_crashdump then
 *   has a chance to save the state of the machine. The provided
 *   board_crashdump should save as much information as it can about the cause
 *   of the fault and then most likely reset the system.
 *
 *   N.B. There are limited system resources that can be used by the provided
 *   board_crashdump function. The tems from the fact that most critical/fatal
 *   crashes are because of a hard fault or during interrupt processing.
 *   In these cases, up_assert is running from the context of an interrupt
 *   handlerand it is impossible to use any device driver in this context.
 *
 *   Also consider the following: Who knows what state the system is in? Is
 *   memory trashed? Is the Heap intact? Therefore all we can expect to do in
 *   board_crashdump is save the "machine state" in a place where on the next
 *   reset we can write it to more sophisticated storage in a sane operating
 *   environment.
